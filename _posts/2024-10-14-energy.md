# Introduction


1) How much DC power is required by the LED to work in its nominal use case? For 50 % of
its nominal luminosity? For 25 % of its nominal luminosity?

25% : 5mA * 1.9V = 0.0095W = 9.5mW
50% : 10mA * 2V = 0.02W = 20mW
100% : 20mA * 2.15 = 0.043W = 43mW

2) How much energy is required to light on the LED during 1 second?

9.5mJ - 20mJ - 43mJ

3) How much power must be provided to the LED to work? For which voltages? What will be
the luminosity of the LED?

1.8V at 5% Relative Luminosity

4) Which configurations of capacitance and activation and deactivation voltage thresholds can
be employed? What is the minimum input DC power required to work in the worst case?
