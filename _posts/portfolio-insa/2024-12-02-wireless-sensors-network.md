# Descriptive Part

The goal of this course was to discover Wireless Sensor Networks by researching on the subject, synthetise a report and present the subject in front of the whole class. 

# Technical Part

The WSN course was articulated in three main parts: the lecture course, the presentation assignements and the technical lab or Bureau d'Etude.

## Lecture Course: WSN Basics

## Presentaiton Assignements

## Bureau d'Etude


# Analytical

Prior to this curriculum I had little to no idea of Wireless Sensor Networks. I found this course; or rather the format of the course; particularly interesting, in fact, while I do not dislike classical lectures, I am not found of them because I think they lack interactivity and are not particularly engaging. For this matter the way the course was organised particularly suited me and I found the Reaserch Part to be extremely enriching. 

## *Why do the format of the course suited me well ?*

Above all, I am a self learner. I enjoy discovering and exploring new subjects by myself. The research-based nature of this course allowed me to develop my knowledge on WSN bu actively searching for informations, reading a lot of academic articles and synthetize all I had learnt into a concise report. This process helped me understand the topic way more efficiently than the standalone lecture. Moreover, now that I have some perspective on the situation I can affirm that the knowledge retention is far superior in a self-research course than in a traditional lecture-based course.

In addition, the presentaiton assignment (both on LoRa and on WSN Mac layers) required me to not only understand the subject but also to be able to explain complex concepts to others in a clear and concise manner. And as we all now, we truly understand a concept when we are able to explain it *well* to others. Preparing and doing the presentation improved greatly my communications skills and my ability to simplify complex technical ideas: in other words: science popularization skills.
