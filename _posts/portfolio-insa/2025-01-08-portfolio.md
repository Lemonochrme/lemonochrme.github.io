# Introduction

## Purpose of the Portfolio

The goal of this portfolio is to present in an organized manner the skills and knowledge I have acquired during my academic journey, alongside the experiences and projects that have contributed to my academical growth. It aims to reflect my learning process, highlight my technical and analytical capabilities, and demonstrate how these align with my future aspirations.

This document also explicitly highlights the theoretical, technological, operational, and relational skills I have acquired. These include, but are not limited to, expertise in electronics, programming, and collaborative problem-solving in complex environments.

Annexed to this portfolio, the reader will find additional documents including project reports, code repositories, and more evidences of the skills and knowledge described in the report.


## Overview of the Content

Each subject of the portfolio is organized into three main parts: the Descriptive Part, which presents the professional and training experiences context; the Technical Part, where specific problem-solving situations are detailed to highlight my skills and knowledge; and the Analytical Part, which provides a comprehensive evaluation of the competencies gained throughout my journey. In a nutshell the first part answer the *"What have I done, and in what context?"* question, the second part *"How did I solve specific technical problems, and what knowledge did I use?"* and finally the last part answer *"What skills have I acquired, and how do they match the training objectives?."*

## Personal Objectives

For me, this portfolio is an opportunity to showcase my technical expertise and growth as an aspiring engineer. It serves as a tool to reflect on my academic and professional journey, to critically assess my progress, and to prepare for the next steps in my career. This document will also help me connect with professionals in my field by presenting my accomplishments in a structured and engaging way.

# Generalities

## About Me

I'm Robin Marin-Muller, an engineering student passionate about exploring complex systems and understanding how they work. My curiosity drives me to ask questions, solve problems, and engage in diverse projects that expand my knowledge and capabilities. This mindset has been the foundation of my academic journey and continues to guide me toward innovative solutions and continuous learning.

## Academic Background

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to become an engineer. This ambition led me to engage in a multitude of personal projects and experiments, allowing me to explore various fields and subjects. However, one area caught my attention in particular: electronics and computer science. These two passions shaped my academic choices and guided me to pursue studies in electronics and automatic control at INSA Toulouse, where I deepened my knowledge in the areas that initially sparked my interest. There, I was able to refine my skills and discover many other fascinating things.
