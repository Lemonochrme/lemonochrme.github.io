# Descriptive Part

The goal of this course was to gain solid foundations in machine learning and IA in general. The objectives included:
- understanding of the characteristics of supervised and unsupervised learning problems, as well as the basic methods and algorithms used to address them. 
- AI at the edge and the optimization techniques required to embed AI algorithms effectively. 
- Use Python libraries to solve real-world problems (with IoT data).

# Technical Part

## Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of the vast and electric world of Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.

Machine Learning *for IoT* focuses on

> Artificial Intelligence > Machine Learning > Deep Learning

Resource Constraints in Edge AI

- Very low processing power and memory.
- Use of Digital Signal Processors (DSP) or Neural Processing Units (NPU) to optimize performance and efficiency.
- Limited energy availability, necessitating energy-efficient algorithms and hardware.
- Real-time processing requirements, demanding low-latency solutions.
