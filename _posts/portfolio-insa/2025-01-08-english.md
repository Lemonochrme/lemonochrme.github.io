# Descriptive Part

The goal of this course was to improve our communication skills in the English language, this covered oral communication through bimensual presentation but also writing and listening skills. The course was thought to complete the Innovative Project course on all the communication aspects: sprint presentations, slides and project report.

# Technical Part

The technical aspect of the course covered techniques on how to properly write a presentation, and improve our speaking ability.

// Present technical aspects like presentation and speaking good practices: do not put your hands in pockets, be clear, look and speak TO the audience, do not point the screen with hands etc...

// Pronunciation skills


# Analytical

Communication skills are essentials, communication skills in English even more. It is a necessity for me to master oratory skills as I want to pursue my academical journey in the reseach field. Having a feedback on these important aspects was truly apreciated as it enabled me to correct and improve my English communication skills.
