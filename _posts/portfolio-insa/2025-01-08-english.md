# Descriptive Part

The goal of this course was to improve our communication skills in the English language, this covered oral communication through bimensual presentation but also writing and listening skills. The course was thought to complete the Innovative Project course on all the communication aspects: sprint presentations, slides and project report.

## Speaking Skills and Body Language

In terms of speaking skills, we learned the importance of body language and posture. For example, keeping a confident stance, avoiding putting hands in pockets, and using controlled gestures helped convey professionalism and clarity. Eye contact was emphasized as a key element to connect with the audience and ensure engagement. Speaking directly to the audience, rather than to the screen or slides, created a more interactive and impactful presentation.


## Pronunciation and Oratory Skills

Pronunciation and vocal delivery were also major areas of focus. We practiced enunciating words clearly to avoid misunderstandings. Techniques like varying tone and pace helped make the presentations more dynamic and less monotonous. Feedback sessions allowed us to identify and correct common issues, such as mumbling or overusing filler words like "euh".








# Analytical

Communication skills are essentials, communication skills in English even more. It is a necessity for me to master oratory skills as I want to pursue my academical journey in the reseach field. Having a feedback on these important aspects was truly apreciated as it enabled me to correct and improve my English communication skills.
