# Descriptive Part

This "Grand Domaine" was separated into four different courses: Service Oriented Architecture, Middleware, Software Engineering and Cloud and Edge Computing. 

- For SOA, the goal was to get an introduction to service-oriented web development through an online course and two lab projects where we had to use the concepts learned along the way. 

- For Middleware, the format was a bit different. While the course was also online, the practical work was much more guided and took the form of standard "Travaux Pratiques" where we experienced the different concepts: oneM2M, MQTT, ACME or node-red.

- For Cloud and Edge Computing the goal was to understand the basics of cloud infrastructure and operation. The course was focused on Open Stack and Virtualization.

- The Software Engineering part was done through the course of the innovative project where we adopted a Agile methodology and the Service Oriented Architecture project labs where we had to implement a CI/CD pipeline for the application we where developping.

# Technical Part

## Service Architecture

## Software Engineering

I wrote an entire report on Software Engineering with a focus on DevOps, available here: [Automation and DevOps in the Space Industry: Focus on GitLab-CI][1]
