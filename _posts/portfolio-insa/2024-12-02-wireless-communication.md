## Communication Protocols for LP-WAN

### IoT network characteristics and specificities

IoT networks and particularly LP-WANs (Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) have specific characteristics and constraints that make them very different from standard computer networks.

From an energy efficiency point of view, IoT devices are most of the time battery-powered and absolutely need to conserve energy. Because changing a battery is expensive both in time and cost, the lifetime of IoT system on self suffient power source can range from one month to a year base the specific application. Duty cycles and efficient power management is then essential to minimize energy consumption.

Because of energy efficiency and other parameters like Physical Layer limitation (LoRa for instance limits its packets size to 256 bytes), IoT networks typically transmit very small amounts of data. In the case of LP-WAN: 20 to 250kbps. 

We can define Internet as generally distance agnostic, so much that we don't think much about distance in conventional networks. However, this is absolutely not the case with IoT networks because of Physical Layer limitation. These networks generally have short (few meters) to medium (E.g. few kilometers with LoRa) range when talking node to node (or one hop) communication. Multi-hop or mesh topologies can greatly extend this range. Still because of the reliance on rf communication of the Physical Layer, communications in IoT networks are easily subject to interferences from various sources like other devices using the same channel or environmental channel like signal attenuation/reflection. This results in an unpredictable and variable communication link quality. Moreover, in contrary to Internet and other common static networks, IoT networks can be extensively mobile and require specific mechanism to manage node movement and dynamic topology reshaping.

The essence of IoT networks is to connect a large number of devices, this require efficient mechanisms to manage the important traffic generated by the network. For example, in a mesh IoT network, each nodes role may be threefold: send, receiver and route packets.

The application being deployed on the IoT network directly influence its capabilities. For example some IoT applications may demand very low latency while other may require reliability. Most of application require some soft of security protocols in order to provide confidentiality, integrity and/or authentication while being very low in overhead due to limited ressources.

Due to IoT networks being generally scaled, individual IoT devices need to be low-cost.


IEEE 802.15.4 for LR WPAN (Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Network) limit packet sizes to optimize energy efficiency and minimize complexity at the cost of requiring fragmentation for larger data structure. 

Like explained earlier, IoT networks can take a variety of topology forms depending on the specific application. For example mesh, star and tree topologies are very common.

### Rationale for adopting an IPv6 based architecture to support the communications of an IoT system or use case

IPv4 address space: $4,294,967,296$ uniquely identified devices.

IPv6 address space: $340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456$ uniquely identified devices.

Based on the informations above-cited, we can clearly see why we do not use IPv4 architecture to support IoT networks communications. The address space provided by IPv4 is unsufficient to support the exponentially growing number of uniquely identified IoT devices.

IPv6 provides a vast address space (nearly $8^{28}$ times IPv4) suitable for large scale IoT networks where every device needs to be uniquely identified. In addition, IPv6 is compatible with LP-WAN  \footnote{LP-WAN: Low Power Wide Area Network} (E.g. [IEEE 802.15.4](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.15.4/7029/)) making it suitable for most IoT application demanding low-power and low data rate. This is partially due to the fact that techniques like 6LoWPAN. 

6LoWPAN enable header compression in order to reduce drastically overhead, this help integrate IPv6 to constrained IoT networks.

One can argue that using IPv6 on a simple IoT network is overengineered but the fact that IPv6 allows IoT devices to be integrated seamlessly with Internet, enabling unmatched access to all types of communications is a turning point in IoT networks. Moreover, IPv6 supports multi-hop\footnote{Multi-hop: information is passed through multiple intermediate nodes before reaching its final destination} routing. This is critical when the network is very large (i.e. spreading across a wide area) and point-to-point communication impossible.

Even if fragmentation is considered by many to be very costful in term of ressources or medium utilization, IPv6 provide this feature.
