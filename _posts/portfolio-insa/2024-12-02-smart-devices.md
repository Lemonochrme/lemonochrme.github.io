# Descriptive Part

## AIME Lab Work

 The gaz sensor is a project we carried out over the course of a week at the AIME micro-electronics laboratory. The goal was to make a nano-particle based passive gaz sensor using micro-electronics technology available in the lab. The work implied the following steps:
- Synthetize the $WO_3$ nano-particules using basic chemistry
- Coating the polysilicon substract with photosensible resin to protect the useful circuit.
- Dip the substract into acid to remove unwanted conductive parts of the circuit.
- Clean the substract.
- Powder the substract with nano-particles and check that it is coated evenly on the conductive combs.
- Cut the individual silicon dices off the wafer.
- Wire bond the die to the package using ultrasonic bonding.
- Characterize the gas sensor resistance.

## Microcontroller and Opensource Hardware (MOS&H)

This project is the continuity of the work we achieved at the AIME lab concerning the nano-particle gaz sensor. The goal was to integrate the analog gaz sensor into a complete embedded IoT system.

## Sensors Introduction

The goal was to gain basic knowledge about different types of sensors (actives, passives) and how to implement/use them in a system.

## Analog Electronics Lab

This part, like the MOS&H was part of the continuity of the AIME work. The goal was to integrate the analog gaz sensor into a complete analog chain for microcontroller integration.

## Microcontroller and Opensource Hardware (MOS&H)

I strongly believe that Open Source Hardware is the key to achieving sustainability, both in technology and in the way we solve real-world problems. Open Source empowers users by making knowledge accessible and enabling innovation without barriers. Unlike proprietary solutions, Open Source gives everyone the tools to create, improve, and share freely. This approach fosters collaboration and ensures that progress benefits everyone, not just a select few.

In our interdisciplinary innovative project, I had the opportunity to work on a water leak detection project. This project is fully Open Source, from the hardware design to the software code, and everything is accessible to anyone on GitHub. By sharing it openly, we ensure that communities, researchers, and developers worldwide can build upon our work, adapt it to their needs, and potentially create better, more effective solutions for water conservation.

The importance of Open Source lies in its potential for large-scale impact. For instance, our project leverages affordable components like the ESP32-C3, LSM36 IMU, and MEMS microphones to create a network of sensors capable of detecting leaks in water distribution systems. By making our designs and code available, we lower the entry barrier for others to replicate or improve the system. This inclusiveness is a pathway to sustainability because it encourages widespread adoption and innovation.

I support Open Source Hardware because it gives people the ability to learn and take control of the technology they use. It creates an ecosystem where ideas are shared, costs are reduced, and sustainable solutions become scalable. Our project is just one example of how Open Source can empower individuals and communities to make a difference. By embracing this approach, we pave the way for a future where technology is not only sustainable but also equitable and accessible to all. The Internet gave free knowledge to everyone; Open Source and Open Hardware is only the logical continuation of this philosophy. The only philosophy I believe in.
