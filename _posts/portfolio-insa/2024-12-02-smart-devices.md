# Descriptive Part

## AIME Lab Work

 The gaz sensor is a project we carried out over the course of a week at the AIME micro-electronics laboratory. The goal was to make a nano-particle based passive gaz sensor using micro-electronics technology available in the lab. The work implied the following steps:
- Synthetize the $WO_3$ nano-particules using basic chemistry
- Coating the polysilicon substract with photosensible resin to protect the useful circuit.
- Dip the subtract into acid to remove unwanted conductive parts of the circuit.
- Clean the subtract.
- Powder the subtract using electrophoresis with nano-particles and check that it is coated evenly on the conductive combs.
- Cut the individual silicon dices off the wafer.
- Wire bond the die to the package using ultrasonic bonding.
- Characterize the gas sensor resistance.

## Microcontroller and Open Source Hardware (MOS&H)

This project is the continuity of the work we achieved at the AIME lab concerning the nano-particle gaz sensor. The goal was to integrate the analog gaz sensor into a complete embedded IoT system.

## Sensors Introduction

The goal was to gain basic knowledge about different types of sensors (actives, passives) and how to implement/use them in a system.

## Analog Electronics Lab

This part, like the MOSH was part of the continuity of the AIME work. The goal was to integrate the analog gas sensor into a complete analog chain for microcontroller integration.

## Microcontroller and Open Source Hardware (MOSH)

I strongly believe that Open Source and Open Hardware is the key to achieving sustainability, both in technology and the consumer industry. Open Source encourage accessible knowledge and accelerate innovation. Unlike proprietary solutions, Open Source gives everyone the  tools to create, improve and share freely ensuring progress benefits everyone, not just a select few.

In out interdisciplinary innovative project, I worked on a non-intrusive cutting edge water leak detection system. We choose to make this project fully Open Source, from the hardware design to the software source code: everything is accessible to anyone on GitHub. By sharing it openly we ensure and everyone (researchers, developers, students...) can build on top our work  adapt it to their needs and create better solutions.

Isaac Newton once said, *"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."* What progress could he have made if science had been private and secret?

I strongly support Open Source because it gives people the ability to learn and take control of the technology they use. The Internet gave free knowledge to everyone; Open Source and Open Hardware is only the logical continuation of this philosophy. A philosophy in which I believe.
