# Descriptive Part

## AIME Lab Work

 The gaz sensor is a project we carried out over the course of a week at the AIME micro-electronics laboratory. The goal was to make a nano-particle based passive gaz sensor using micro-electronics technology available in the lab. The work implied the following steps:
- Synthetize the $WO_3$ nano-particules using basic chemistry
- Coating the polysilicon substract with photosensible resin to protect the useful circuit.
- Dip the substract into acid to remove unwanted conductive parts of the circuit.
- Clean the substract.
- Powder the substract with nano-particles and check that it is coated evenly on the conductive combs.
- Cut the individual silicon dices off the wafer.
- Wire bond the die to the package using ultrasonic bonding.
- Characterize the gas sensor resistance.

## Microcontroller and Opensource Hardware (MOS&H)

This project is the continuity of the work we achieved at the AIME lab concerning the nano-particle gaz sensor. The goal was to integrate the analog gaz sensor into a complete embedded IoT system.

## Sensors Introduction

The goal was to gain basic knowledge about different types of sensors (actives, passives) and how to implement/use them in a system.

## Analog Electronics Lab

This part, like the MOS&H was part of the continuity of the AIME work. The goal was to integrate the analog gaz sensor into a complete analog chain for microcontroller integration.
