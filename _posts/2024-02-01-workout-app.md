# Goal of the project
I needed a journaling app to record my workouts and keep me motivated. As I didn't find any application that suited me well, I decided to develop my own mobile application: *Essentiel*. This app aims to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users to log their workouts, track progress, and stay motivated on their fitness journey.


# Design and Specification

Using previous experience in graphic design, I could rapidly design a mockup of the full user-interface using Figma.

## The color palette

As the name of the application suggest it, the goal of the user interface is to be straight-to-the-point, easy to use and minimalistic. Hence, I opted for a nuance gradient instead of the a color palette to avoid distrations and focus on the goal: journaling.
