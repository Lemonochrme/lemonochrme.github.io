# Introduction
The project focuses on developing an autonomous flying wing, with the eventual goal of integrating a payload. While the payload specifics are still undecided, potential applications include **computer vision for mapping** and **biome recognition**. For now, the priority is on building the platform itself and making sure the flight control system works smoothly.

Key features of the project include:

- **Stable Flying**: Ensuring the flying wing maintains a steady and controlled flight.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Implementing a flight control system capable of following GPS-defined paths.
- **Payload Integration**: Designing the platform to accommodate various payloads for different applications.
