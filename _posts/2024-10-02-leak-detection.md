## Introduction

Water consumption is one of the critical utilities in a household, yet it is often difficult to monitor effectively. With the rising concerns over water conservation and the financial impact of undetected leaks, having a smart system that can both monitor water usage and detect potential leaks becomes essential. This project presents a smart water monitoring and leak detection system using an **ESP32** microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors to measure water flow in a household or apartment. The system is designed to help users track their water consumption, detect leaks in real-time, and receive alerts, all through a web or mobile application.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an **IoT-based water monitoring system** that can monitor a home's water consumption and detect possible leaks. The system leverages the **ESP32** for real-time water flow measurements and uses **two ultrasonic transceivers** attached externally to a water pipe to calculate the flow rate non-invasively. The collected data is transmitted via **Wi-Fi** to a remote server for further analysis and storage. By incorporating advanced analysis techniques, possibly using **machine learning algorithms**, the system will be able to distinguish between normal water usage patterns and abnormal behaviors that may indicate leaks.

Users will be notified via **email** or other communication channels if a potential leak is detected. Additionally, the system provides a **user-friendly interface** for tracking real-time and historical water consumption through a dedicated application. This application will also enable users to view daily, weekly, or monthly water usage trends, helping them better understand their consumption patterns and take action when necessary.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Components:
- **ESP32**: A powerful microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi capabilities, used for data acquisition and wireless communication.
- **Ultrasonic transceivers**: Two sensors are placed on the outside of the water pipe to measure water flow using the transit-time method.
- **Power supply**: To power the ESP32 and the sensors.

### Software Components:
- **Flow measurement algorithm**: Embedded in the ESP32, this algorithm will calculate water flow based on the transit times of ultrasonic waves.
- **Data transmission**: Water consumption data will be transmitted via Wi-Fi to a remote server in real-time.
- **Remote server**: This server will store water usage data in a **database** (e.g., **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**), and a **machine learning model** could be implemented to detect anomalies in water consumption patterns, such as leaks.
- **User notifications**: If an anomaly is detected, the system will trigger an email notification to alert the user of a potential water leak.

### Monitoring Application:
- **Tech stack**: The monitoring application will be built using modern web technologies like **React** or **Vue.js** for the frontend, while the backend could be implemented using **Node.js** with an **Express** server. The app will pull water usage data from the database and present it in a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **Database**: A relational database like **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** will store user data, water consumption history, and detected leak events.
- **User notifications**: The backend will integrate with a **mail service API** (e.g., **SendGrid** or **SMTP**) to send alerts about potential water leaks.
- **Mobile app**: An additional mobile interface could be built using **React Native** or **Flutter** to enable on-the-go monitoring and control.

### Future Enhancements:
- **AI-driven insights**: The system could eventually incorporate AI to optimize water usage recommendations based on user habits.
- **Integration with smart home ecosystems**: The system could be extended to interface with smart home hubs (e.g., **Google Home** or **Amazon Alexa**), enabling voice commands and automation triggers based on water usage data.
