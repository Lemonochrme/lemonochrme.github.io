I’m Robin Marin-Muller, an engineering student with a strong interest in space technologies, embedded systems and electronics. I like to explore the entire stack, from physical hardware and sensors to firmware, architecture and system.

Since the beginning of my studies, I’ve been driven by the need to understand how things work, not only at the surface, but in depth: signals, protocols, logic, control and the science behind all of this. This curiosity has guided me through academic work, personal projects and three years of experience at CNES.

I see engineering as a way to explore and build, using technical tools to solve real problems. The projects in this portfolio reflect my approach: concrete, multidisciplinary, and always focused on learning through making.
