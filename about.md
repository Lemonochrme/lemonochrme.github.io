Iâ€™m Robin Marin-Muller, an engineering student passionate about exploring complex systems and understanding how they work. My curiosity drives me to ask questions, solve problems, and engage in diverse projects that expand my knowledge and capabilities. This mindset has been the foundation of my academic journey and continues to guide me toward innovative solutions and continuous learning.

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to become an engineer. This ambition led me to engage in a multitude of personal projects and experiments, allowing me to explore various fields and subjects. However, one area caught my attention in particular: electronics and computer science. These two passions shaped my academic choices and guided me to pursue studies in electronics and automatic control at INSA Toulouse, where I deepened my knowledge in the areas that initially sparked my interest. There, I was able to refine my skills and discover many other fascinating things.
